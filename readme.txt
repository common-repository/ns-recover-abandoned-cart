Helps to find out how many lost carts your store has by keeping track when users abandon them. It also sends an mail to those users to help recover the cart.


== Description ==


You can simply configure this plugin visiting the NS Recover Abandoned Cart inside WordPress backend menu where you can find three tabs:
Setting, report and Statistics.

In Settings tab you can:
- specify the timeout after which an email will be sent to users with PENDING state cart.
- choose a timeout to set the ABANDONED state to carts.
- Set the mail template and color that you prefer.
- Choose the mail sender.
- Body mail entirely customizable.

In Report tab you can see all data carts.

<b>!IMPORTANT!</b> 
- to set COMPLETED or RESTORED cart status the woocommerce order status must be COMPLETED!
- the Recover Abandoned Cart free plug-in is a trial version where you can keep track of 1000 carts!
- for a major compatibility we recommend to set the appropriately flag in Woocommerce -> Settings -> Accounts & Privacy to keep track of guest users and store their email!
